#' Synthetic Aperture Personality Assessment
#'
#' SAPA is a dataset borrowed from the psych package (Revelle, 2015). SAPA was taken from  the Synthetic Aperture Personality Assessment (SAPA), which is a web based personality assessment project. SAPA consists of 16 multiple-choice items responded by 1525 examinees. All the items are scored dichotomously.

#' @details 16 items were sampled from 80 items given as part of the SAPA (\url{http://sapa-project.org}) project  (Condon and Revelle, 2014; Revelle, Wilt and Rosenthal, 2009) to develop online measures of ability. These 16 items reflect four lower order factors (verbal reasoning, letter series, matrix reasoning, and spatial rotations.  These lower level factors all share a higher level factor ('g'). This data set is a good example of doing item analysis to examine the empirical response probabilities of each item alternative as a function of the underlying latent trait. When doing this, it appears that two of the matrix reasoning problems do not have monotonically increasing trace lines for the probability correct.  At moderately high ability (theta = 1), there is a decrease in the probability correct from theta = 0 and theta = 2.
#' @source The example data set is taken from the Synthetic Aperture Personality Assessment personality and ability test at \url{http://sapa-project.org}. The data were collected with David Condon from 8/08/12 to 8/31/12.

#' Humor Styles Questionnaire

#' \item{Q29}{I usually can't think of witty things to say when I'm with other people.}
#' \item{Q30}{I don't need to be with other people to feel amused – I can usually find things to laugh about even when I'm by myself.}

#' @details Responses for negatively worded statements (Q1, Q7, Q9, Q15, Q16, Q17, Q22, Q23, Q25, Q29, Q31) have been reverse-coded (i.e., 1=Very often or always true, 2=Often true, 3= Sometimes true, 4=Rarely true, 5=Never or very rarely true) in order to have the same direction (i.e., high values indicate more humorous personality) in all items.

#' The participants of this study were 50 eighth-grade students and 17 math teachers. The sample of teachers was selected to represent a range of experiences. Years of experience as a teacher ranged from one year to 26 years in the sample. Students, teachers, and performance tasks were fully crossed facets. All students in the sample responded to the same questions in a performance assessment. The responses of all the students were graded by each of the seventeen teachers.
