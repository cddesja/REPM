\description{
The Humor Styles Questionnaire (HSQ) data set comes from an interactive online version of the Humor Styles Questionnaire (Martin, Puhlik-Doris, Larsen, Gray, \& Weir, 2003).
}
\details{
Responses for negatively worded statements (Q1, Q7, Q9, Q15, Q16, Q17, Q22, Q23, Q25, Q29, Q31) have been reverse-coded (i.e., 1=Very often or always true, 2=Often true, 3= Sometimes true, 4=Rarely true, 5=Never or very rarely true) in order to have the same direction (i.e., high values indicate more humorous personality) in all items.
