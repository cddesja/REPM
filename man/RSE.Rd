\description{
The RSE data set was obtained via online with an interactive version of the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Rosenberg, 1965). Individuals were informed at the start of the test that their data would be saved. When they completed the scale, they were asked to confirm that the responses they had given were accurate and could be used for research, only those who confirmed are included in this dataset. 

A random sample of 1000 participants who completed all of the items in the scale were included in the RSE data set. All of the 10 rating scale items were rated on a 4-point scale (i.e., 1=strongly disagree, 2=disagree, 3=agree, and 4=strongly agree). Items 3, 5, 8, 9 and 10 were reversed-coded in order to place all the items in the same direction. That is, higher scores indicate higher self-esteem.
