\description{
SAPA is a dataset borrowed from the psych package (Revelle, 2015). SAPA was taken from  the Synthetic Aperture Personality Assessment (SAPA), which is a web based personality assessment project. SAPA consists of 16 multiple-choice items responded by 1525 examinees. All the items are scored dichotomously.
}
\details{
16 items were sampled from 80 items given as part of the SAPA (\url{http://sapa-project.org}) project  (Condon and Revelle, 2014; Revelle, Wilt and Rosenthal, 2009) to develop online measures of ability. These 16 items reflect four lower order factors (verbal reasoning, letter series, matrix reasoning, and spatial rotations.  These lower level factors all share a higher level factor ('g'). This data set is a good example of doing item analysis to examine the empirical response probabilities of each item alternative as a function of the underlying latent trait. When doing this, it appears that two of the matrix reasoning problems do not have monotonically increasing trace lines for the probability correct.  At moderately high ability (theta = 1), there is a decrease in the probability correct from theta = 0 and theta = 2.
